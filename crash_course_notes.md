VARIABLES

# MESSAGE HERE IS A VARIABLE
# VARIABLES CAN BE USED TO STORE INFORMATION
# AND REFERENCE IT LATER IN YOUR CODE
# EVERY VARIABLE IS CONNECTED TO A VALUE
# THE VALUE CAN BE A STRING, A NUMBER, A LIST, ETC.
# IN THIS CASE, THE VALUE IS A STRING
# STRINGS ARE SEQUENCES OF CHARACTERS
# STRINGS ARE WRAPPED IN QUOTATION MARKS
# YOU CAN USE SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES






#####################################
# WHEN I USE VAIRABLES I NEED TO KEEP THESE THINGS IN MIND. SOME OF THEM ARE CURIAL AND BREAKING THEM WILL CAUSE ERRIRS AND SOME OTHERS HELP ME TO WRITE THAT IS EASY TO READ AND DEBUG CODE.
# 1. VARIABLE NAMES CAN ONLY CONTAIN LETTERS,NUMBERS AND UNDERSCORES. THEY CAN BE STARTED WITH A LETTER OR UNDERSCORE BUT NOT A NUMBER.EXAMPLE: message_1 (correct), 1_message(wrong).
# 2. SPACEES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN VARIABLES AND UNDERSCORES CAN BE USED INSTEAD. EXAMPLE: greeting_messag(correct), greeting message(error)
# 3. I SHOULD AVOID USING WORDS RESERVED FOR PROGRAMMATIC PURPOSES.
# 4. I SHOULD MAKE SURE VARIABLE NAMES I USE HAVE MEANING THAT IS DESCRIPTIVE OF WHAT I WANT
# 5. I SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHEN USING LETTERS THAT CAN BE CONFUSED WITH NUMBERS. EXAMPLE: l >> 1, O >> 0

# Python, bool (short for Boolean) is a fundamental data type that can only have one of two possible values: True or False.
# Think of it as a simple on/off switch, a yes/no answer, or a statement being correct or incorrect.

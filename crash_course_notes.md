VARIABLES

# MESSAGE HERE IS A VARIABLE
# VARIABLES CAN BE USED TO STORE INFORMATION
# AND REFERENCE IT LATER IN YOUR CODE
# EVERY VARIABLE IS CONNECTED TO A VALUE
# THE VALUE CAN BE A STRING, A NUMBER, A LIST, ETC.
# IN THIS CASE, THE VALUE IS A STRING
# STRINGS ARE SEQUENCES OF CHARACTERS
# STRINGS ARE WRAPPED IN QUOTATION MARKS
# YOU CAN USE SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES






#####################################
# WHEN I USE VAIRABLES I NEED TO KEEP THESE THINGS IN MIND. SOME OF THEM ARE CURIAL AND BREAKING THEM WILL CAUSE ERRIRS AND SOME OTHERS HELP ME TO WRITE THAT IS EASY TO READ AND DEBUG CODE.
# 1. VARIABLE NAMES CAN ONLY CONTAIN LETTERS,NUMBERS AND UNDERSCORES. THEY CAN BE STARTED WITH A LETTER OR UNDERSCORE BUT NOT A NUMBER.EXAMPLE: message_1 (correct), 1_message(wrong).
# 2. SPACEES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN VARIABLES AND UNDERSCORES CAN BE USED INSTEAD. EXAMPLE: greeting_messag(correct), greeting message(error)
# 3. I SHOULD AVOID USING WORDS RESERVED FOR PROGRAMMATIC PURPOSES.
# 4. I SHOULD MAKE SURE VARIABLE NAMES I USE HAVE MEANING THAT IS DESCRIPTIVE OF WHAT I WANT
# 5. I SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHEN USING LETTERS THAT CAN BE CONFUSED WITH NUMBERS. EXAMPLE: l >> 1, O >> 0

# Python, bool (short for Boolean) is a fundamental data type that can only have one of two possible values: True or False.
# Think of it as a simple on/off switch, a yes/no answer, or a statement being correct or incorrect.




#  line 13
is there fucking smht. say yes or no

# line 14,15
say yes or no

# line 16
can be used to remove space or character in the beginning and at the end   

# line 19
use for list

# line 20 
is used to find the index of the (). means index of()

# when using [] in order to get into the list, we cant push forward when we hit number itself but if it is a letter then 0 s and -1 s will not return error

# line 21
used just like int and it is used to turn strings into list

# line 23
used to put a value to a particular index   (1,2)  2 to index 1
# i should be careful when using insert with coz that means insert BEFORE.... or AT THAT EXACT POSITION (not the case with 0>x numbers)
# if i wanna insert to the end i can use len just like this len(my_list) meaning the length refers to the end argumement and insert puts after the that argument, or i can just use appen() which by default places to the end.



# line 24
takes a value not an argument, del my_list will delete the whole variable which then returns error

# line 25
takes an index

# line 26
takes an index
it removes the valu in that index
it can also print the value in that index if used with print

# line 28
*=x literally means repeat it x times 

# line 29
constant is a veriable whose value doesnt change throughout the whole programm. Python programmers use capital letters to show that it is a constant for example: MAX_CONNECTIONS = 200

# line 30 
sort()   the change is permanent. usage:   .sort()
sorted()  the change is temporary. usage:  sorted(value comes here)

# line 32
reverse just reverses the order of items inside the list
and it works permamanently and we want the list back we can just reverse it second time


#  using append we cant add lists togther but we can insert one into another, if i wanna add then i can just use +
